This mockup is an example of a landing page for a cryptocurrency exchange. Cryptocurrency price date is fed to the landing page using the CoinGecko open API.

- Utilize the API_Source_List.md as a resouce. The file contains a list of API options you can use for this project as well as helpful documentation.

- When starting the project, first ensure that your DOM objects and API endpoint(s) function as intended before continuing with the rest of the build.
