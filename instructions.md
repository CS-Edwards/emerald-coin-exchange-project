# API Demo - Emerald Coin Exchange

In this portfolio project, you will build a simple page that incorporates data from APIs.

This mockup is an example of a landing page for a cryptocurrency exchange. Cryptocurrency price date is fed to the landing page using the CoinGecko open API. 

Successful completion of the project implements API endpoints into a responsive webpage.

## Learning Outcomes
- Define a project design as a team
- Organize a development plan and divide project responsibilities
- Use a simple task management tool to create, coordinate, and track project tasks
- Collaborate through github, using pull requests and branches properly
- Use an API to fetch data and manipulate the DOM to display the data on a page
- Present the finished work of a team to effectively communicate how the solution was defined and developed

## Getting Started Notes

- Your site should be based on the design you and your team have created. The code provided is **only an example** of how to incorporate an API into a webpage. 
- When starting the project, first ensure that your DOM objects and API endpoint(s) function as intended before continuing with the rest of the build.

## Resouces
- Utilize the [API_Source_List.md]([#](https://github.com/CS-Edwards/emerald-coin-exchange-project/blob/main/API_Source_List.md)) as a resouce. The file contains a list of API options you can use for this project as well as helpful documentation.
